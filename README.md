## Lore
The Astral Wanderers are a lost race of humans who, through the desperation of survival, evolved beyond the constraints of their original world. Originating from a civilisation on the brink of extinction, these beings embarked on a journey through the cosmos, seeking refuge among the stars. Dressed in advanced space suits that serve as both their lifeline and shield, they became one with the very fabric of space-time.
